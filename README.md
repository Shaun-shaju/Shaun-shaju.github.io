# Protfolio Website of S. Shaun Benedict

I am Shaun studying at Chavara Public School, Pala. Coming from the background of Computer Science as my <a href="http://sbenedictglobal.com" style="text-decoration: none;">father</a> and mother are from this field, right from the early age I got intorduced to various fields of Computer Science.

For the near days, I got greatly involved in developing OS (Operating Systems), AI (Artificial Intelligence), HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) website making and also have made the first mini research paper.
